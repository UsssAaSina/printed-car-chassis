# Fablab 77 supported fully 3D printed car
An open source car developed by Vladimir Aleynikov, designed to be fully created within Fablab.

Tools required:
 1. 3D printer (0.4mm nozzle preferable, chassis parts can be printed with 0.6 or 0.8)
 2. (optional) 30W+ laser cutter for chassis

Parts needed:
 1. 3D printing filament (PLA or PETG preferred) suitable for printed used, around 2 lb necessary
 1. I suggest the tires to be [printed with FLEX filament](wheels/wheel_flex.stl). If it's impossible, they can be [molded](wheels/molds) with sanitary/automotive sealant
 2. Junction axes: M3 screws or 2.5mm steel wire
 3. Axes: 5mm rod (steel/bamboo/extruded plastic): 4x 35mm chunks, with chamfer
 4. 14x 105ZZ bearings
 5. Servo (tested with 996MG)
 6. 600-sized motor
 7. Electronic parts: ESC for the motor, receiver, controller

The sample built uses the following screws set:
 1. M3*8 screw x8
 2. M3*10 screw x21
 3. M3*6 screw x26
 4. M3x50 screw with flat shaft for suspension x4
 5. M5x40 screw for front wheel axles
